# Project-3-Group 3 

### Project idea: 
Showcasing organ donation and transplantation across the American States for the following organs: Heart, Kidney, Kidney-Pancreas, Liver, Lung, Pancreas, and All. 

Data was obtained from the Health Resources and Service Administration: https://data.hrsa.gov/data/download. Includes data from January 1, 2017 - and December 31, 2022.

#### The following CSVs will be used for this project: 
1. overview-national.csv: Lovepreet and Keyana
 This visualization will include two bar charts: one for living donors/recipients and one for decreased organs/recipients:
- x-axis: years 2017-2022
- y-axis: count
  each bar chart will be grouped with one bar for donors and one bar for recipients per each year 

  
2. overview-state.csv: Alexandru and Keyana
We will focus on the Transplant Recipients category. This visualization will show the recipient count across the 50 states suing Chloropleth. Users will be able to select the year from 2017-2022 to show the map for each year. When selecting a state, a popup will show the recipient count for all organs, heart, kidney, kidney-pancreas, liver, lung, and pancreas.       

4. recipient-demographics: Yasmin and Keyana
Demographic data will be displayed for the following:
- Sex: pie chart for each year
- Age: 6 bins displayed in a histogram for each year
- Race: 7 bins displayed in a pie chart for each year

5. Limitations:
Limitation #1: Dataset is large and extensive, presenting it as counts and percentages may not reflect and capture that full complexity of the data

Limitation #2: Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) suppressed some data to maintain privacy of individuals: 
HRSA lists all counts less than 16 as “suppressed”. This is to avoid possible back calculation of the category
