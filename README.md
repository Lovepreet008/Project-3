# Project-3-Group 3 

### Project idea: 
Showcasing organ donation and transplantation across the American States for the following organs: Heart, Kidney, Kidney-Pancreas, Liver, Lung, Pancreas, and All. 

Data was obtained from the Health Resources and Service Administration: https://data.hrsa.gov/data/download. Includes data from January 1, 2017 - December 31, 2022.

#### The following CSVs will be used for this project: 
1. overview-national.csv: contains national numbers per organ per year. We will likely use the following columns:
- Number of deceased organ donors recovered
- Number of living organ donors recovered
- Number of deceased donor organ transplant recipients
- Number of living donor organ transplant recipients
  
2. overview-state.csv: contains counts for each organ per year for each state. Categorized into:
- Deceased organ donors
- Living organ donors
- Waitlist candidates
- Transplant recipients
  
3. donor-demographics.csv: donor count by: type, sex, race/ethnicity, and age group - _note: some demographics are divided by living donors vs deceased donors while others are divided by all donors vs deceased donors_
 

4. recipient-demographics: recipient count by: sex, age group, race/ethnicity, insurance type. Can be grouped by transplant year, donor type (deceased vs living), and organ.
